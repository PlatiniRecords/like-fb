# like_facebook_post(): A function that likes a Facebook post for a given list of accounts.
# Parameters:

like_facebook_post() {
    # Ensure the user has provided all required arguments.
    if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
        echo "Usage: like_facebook_post [button_id] [account_links] [post_link]"
        return 1
    fi

    # Extract the arguments into named variables for clarity.
    local button_id="$1"
    local account_links=("${(@f)$2}")  # Convert the account links string to an array.
    local post_link="$3"

    # Iterate over each account link and simulate the like action.
    for account_link in "${account_links[@]}"; do
        echo "Liking post '$post_link' using account '$account_link'..."
        # Perform the like action using the provided button ID and post link.
        # Replace the following line with the actual code to perform the like action.
        # Example: perform_like_action "$button_id" "$account_link" "$post_link"
    done
}

# Usage example for the "like_facebook_post" function.

# Usage Example:
# Simulate liking a Facebook post using a button with ID "likeButton",
# and a list of Facebook account links ["account1", "account2", "account3"],
# for the post with link "postLink".
echo "Simulating like action on Facebook post..."
like_facebook_post "likeButton" "account1 account2 account3" "postLink"

# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Outputs the status of the like action for each account.
# In this example, it will simulate liking the post "postLink" using the accounts "account1", "account2", and "account3".
# Replace the simulated action with the actual code to perform the like action.

# Note: The actual implementation of the like action will depend on the specific requirements
# and the tools or APIs available for interacting with Facebook's platform.

# Other methods and functions can be added below as needed.

# The rest of the code...
